\chapter*{About the Author}

J.\,R.\ Bhaddacak holds a PhD in Religious Studies and has professional background of computer science and engineering. Nowadays he is an independent researcher/writer/programmer, working alone outside any academic and business milieu. His main field of study is on religion, particularly Therav\=ada Buddhism as a cultural product. Recently he has started investigating into P\=ali language with three goals in mind: first, to make P\=ali more accessible by making it easier to learn; second, to make P\=ali studies more critical by also taking modern literary theory and its kin into account; and third, to produce effective P\=ali learning tools. He is also the maker of \textsc{P\=ali\,Platform}, a comprehensive program for P\=ali learning and research. By the days of writing this book, he lives as a mendicant somewhere in a rural area of Thailand.
